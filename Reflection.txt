The original plan was to keep the portfolio plane with neutral colors, but then I decided to have fun with HTML and CSS since I will most likely not use this for anything professional. With this decision, I added a background image of myself and used HTML and CSS to work with my image. The image spans the entirety of the page, automatically readjusting its size with the width of the window. The titles are neatly aligned in the center of the page, which also automatically change in size as the size of the window is changing. The same can be said about all other text within the portfolio. Originally, I decided to put in other things that I have made in AutoCAD or other computer programs, but since I will not use this professionally, I do not think this is necessary.My Soundscape and Visual Argument each have their own page, where they can be easily accessed from the home screen. I have also included my image on these pages as well as centering the text. The text will also be automatically resized with the width of the page like the home page. As is, my portfolio is a working website that achieved its purpose of having fun and getting a laugh out of it. Those who have seen my portfolio have laughed at the image, but I am hoping others who see it also enjoy it.Overall, my website reflects me, as a company's website would reflect them. Both the soundscape and visual argument reflect me as well.
